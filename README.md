# Introduction
Simple Streamlit app that allows the user to explore 
football data in different ways. The app was born as 
a toy project, and I had my preferences in mind while
doing it. However, I'm sure this can be useful 
or interesting for anyone interested 
in sports analytics. 
Improvements still will be made.

# Data Source
The data is publicly available in the 
FiveThirtyEight Data
repository on GitHub.
