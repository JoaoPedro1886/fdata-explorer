# Football Data Explorer
A Streamlit app for football data exploration.

# Introduction
As a football fan and an enthusiast of the use of data
in sport, I've always enjoyed playing around with data
and visualizing it in different ways. This app was a 
way of making that easy even for non-technical users 
while I was learning how to make apps using Streamlit
&ndash; which, to my surprise, it was a pretty straightforward
process. 

I designed this app for personal use and had my 
preferences in mind while doing it. However, I'm 
sure this can be useful or interesting for anyone 
interested in sports analytics.

# Data Source
The data is publicly available in the 
FiveThirtyEight Data
repository on GitHub.
